# Employee Attrition Prediction with Amazon SageMaker XGBoost

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook implementation of an end-to-end machine learning solution for predicting employee attrition using Amazon SageMaker's built-in XGBoost algorithm.

## Overview

Employee turnover is costly for organizations, with replacement costs averaging 1.5-2x an employee's annual salary. This solution helps HR departments identify employees at risk of leaving, enabling proactive retention strategies.

## Contents

- `hr_attrition_prediction.ipynb`: Main notebook with the complete implementation
- `README.md`: This documentation file

## Features

- Synthetic HR data generation with realistic attrition patterns
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization
- Feature engineering tailored for HR analytics
- Model training using SageMaker's XGBoost implementation
- Model deployment to a SageMaker endpoint
- Performance evaluation and interpretation

## Prerequisites

- AWS account with SageMaker access
- IAM role with appropriate permissions
- Python 3.7+ with the following libraries:
  - boto3
  - sagemaker
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup**: Initialize SageMaker session and define S3 bucket
2. **Data Generation**: Create synthetic employee data with realistic patterns
3. **Exploratory Analysis**: Visualize relationships between features and attrition
4. **Feature Engineering**: Create derived features to improve model performance
5. **Data Preparation**: Split and format data for SageMaker training
6. **Model Training**: Configure and train XGBoost classifier
7. **Deployment**: Deploy model to SageMaker endpoint
8. **Evaluation**: Test model and calculate performance metrics

## Key Model Features

The model considers various factors that may influence employee attrition:

- Age
- YearsAtCompany
- Salary
- JobSatisfaction
- Department
- OverTime
- WorkLifeBalance
- PerformanceRating
- Attrition

## Usage

1. Open the notebook in SageMaker Studio or a SageMaker notebook instance
2. Execute all cells sequentially
3. After deployment, the model endpoint can be integrated with HR systems
4. Use the endpoint for batch prediction or real-time inference


## Customization

To adapt this solution for your organization:
- Replace synthetic data with your actual HR data
- Adjust feature engineering to include organization-specific factors
- Tune hyperparameters based on your dataset characteristics
- Modify the threshold for attrition prediction based on business needs

## Clean Up

To avoid incurring unnecessary charges, remember to:
1. Delete the SageMaker endpoint when not in use
2. Stop or terminate notebook instances
3. Remove data from S3 if no longer needed
